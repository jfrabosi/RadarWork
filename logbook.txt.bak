First day of work. Got the XM125 set up using STM32CubeIDE. Followed the Software User Guide on their documents page 
(https://developer.acconeer.com/home/a121-docs-software/xm125-xe125/). Set up one of the basic examples, the "presence
detection" example. Tuned the example for my particular environment (testing 0.2m-0.6m away, tuned for a faster 
detection dropoff time).

Also, set up the ESP32 with a PlatformIO project. It's basically acting like a repeater, reading the messages from the
STM32 UART and printing them to the USB COM port.

Wrote (with the help of Claude AI) a GUI for visualizing the results from the example. Works pretty well!

Also: did prep work (reviewing documents, datasheets, etc.) yesterday.

Looked through some more documentation (mainly the handbook and the presence / distance example documents), and got the
distance example running. It can see through objects!

Going to try and set it up with the Fo-SHIP so that I can automate testing (and actually verify the measurements to 
ground-truth).


9-18-24 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set up the Fo-SHIP to move in the Z-axis only, and cleaned up the wiring harness (no more IMUs). Calibrated and verified
the Z-axis movement - it's accurate to within 1.34mm of its setpoint. Also, it can follow a set waveform (sum of sines)
to mimic the motion of waves.

I have a thick textbook (DSP book, actually) that is attached to the end effector. I can attach other objects (aluminum
foil, water containers, etc.) to change the end effector material.

Thought I burned the radar board, but it was just a power supply issue. All is good! The STM32 won't run unless the 
debugger (ST-LINK) is powered and attached, though - need to fix this later.

Tuned the distance example a bit more, and ran some automated tests. The radar is pretty accurate with the book alone!
Also, modified the Fo-SHIP motion so that the top end effector sets its roll angle according to the derivative of the
Z-axis function - this makes it look like it's rolling with the waves!


9-22-24 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Read through the distance detector documentation, as well as various other XM125 docs. I have a good feel for how the
system works now, and what I need to change based on the final use case. Also sent JRR an email to clarify that final
use case a bit more.


9-23-24 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got the Bluetooth module on the ESP32 working - I can now communicate with the STM32 through the ESP32's BT serial
(requires a laptop with a PuTTY terminal open for the BT COM port). 

Started to modify the STM32 code so that I can change the configuration of the radar through the BT serial connection. 
This means I can tweak the settings without needing to flash new code to the STM32, and for the final use case, the user
can modify the configuration without needing STM32CubeIDE. Working on a menu dialog to facilitate changing the configs.

Currently, the general menu is made, along with functions to change the start and end distance of the measurement range,
the update rate, and to toggle low power mode (powers off between measurements). I also added a function to test the
actual update rate (may be slightly different than set rate).

Next steps: 
- Finish the switch(case) functions for the other settings, make sure they all work reliably.
- Send the saved configuration back to the ESP32
- Set up the Adalogger to save the configuration and the measured data, and to read the saved configuration on startup
- Find a way to turn on/off the Bluetooth (maybe turn on automatically, turn off if the STM enters low power mode?)
- (future problem) Make sure that the STM32 can start logging data without needing the BT connection first? (like if it
  loses power from solar, then turns on a few minutes later)

Also, started to look at the Adalogger Feather. It seems to use I2C with the ESP32. I'd like to store the configuration
settings for the STM32 on the Adalogger SD card, so that it persists when the system powers down.
