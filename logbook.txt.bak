First day of work. Got the XM125 set up using STM32CubeIDE. Followed the Software User Guide on their documents page 
(https://developer.acconeer.com/home/a121-docs-software/xm125-xe125/). Set up one of the basic examples, the "presence
detection" example. Tuned the example for my particular environment (testing 0.2m-0.6m away, tuned for a faster 
detection dropoff time).

Also, set up the ESP32 with a PlatformIO project. It's basically acting like a repeater, reading the messages from the
STM32 UART and printing them to the USB COM port.

Wrote (with the help of Claude AI) a GUI for visualizing the results from the example. Works pretty well!

Also: did prep work (reviewing documents, datasheets, etc.) yesterday.

Looked through some more documentation (mainly the handbook and the presence / distance example documents), and got the
distance example running. It can see through objects!

Going to try and set it up with the Fo-SHIP so that I can automate testing (and actually verify the measurements to 
ground-truth).
